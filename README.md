## How to print
The files should be working for both A4 and letter size paper - just make sure you print att 100% scale. The map, the stock market and the phase board with the train and ship cards is in A3 size, but you can split them if you have to.

The certificates and train and ship cards are fine in 100% scale, but they can be printed in 105% scale on A4 if you prefer a little bigger cards (with 105% they become about 44x67mm). I don't think 105% works on letter paper.

The big map board comes in one pdf, you need to print it in software that permits printing a poster. Four A3 sheets works just fine. Make sure to print at 100% scale, or the same scale as you print the tiles. At 100% you get the standard size for the tiles (1.5 side-to-side) and the map. There is a low-ink version of the map for those that prefer a more minimalistic look or just want to save ink. They have otherwise equal game-wise, so you don't have to print both!

I prefer to print on A4 adhesive paper and then mount on a little thicker paper to get the card feeling, but you can also laminate or do whatever you prefer.

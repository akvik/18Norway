# 18Norway
18Norway is an 18XX game based on Francis Treshamâ€™s 1829, and follows the development of the Norwegian railroad from 1854 onward. You will be dealing with harsh weather and difficult terrain as you build your track across hills and mountains and around the fjords along the jagged North Sea coast line. All the while, companies have to take the inevitable nationalization into account. - [link to BoardGameGeek entry](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/394787/18norway)

## How to print
The files should be working for both A4 and Letter size paper - just make sure you print att 100% scale. The map, the stock market and the phase board with the train and ship cards is in A3 or Tabloid Size, but you can split them into A4/Letter if you have to.

The certificates and train and ship cards are fine in 100% scale, but they can be printed in 105% scale on A4 if you prefer a little bigger cards (with 105% they become about 44x67mm). I don't think 105% works on Letter paper.

The big map board comes in one pdf, you need to print it in software that permits printing a poster. Four A3 sheets works just fine. Make sure to print at 100% scale, or the same scale as you print the tiles. At 100% you get the standard size for the tiles (1.5 side-to-side) and the map. There is a low-ink version of the map for those that prefer a more minimalistic look or just want to save ink. They have otherwise equal game-wise, so you don't have to print both!

I prefer to print on A4 adhesive paper and then mount on a little thicker paper to get the card feeling, but you can also laminate or do whatever you prefer. In any case, I strongly recommend you use a rotary cutter to cut the cards and tiles - once you've gotten used to those nice cuts there is no going back.
